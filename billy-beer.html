            <p class="col-span-full l-col-start-1 l-col-end-10">This project involves picking a failed beverage brand, and giving it a complete refresh, with an entirely new brand identity. It involves planning, and coming up with brand guidelines and identity, as well as creating a responsive webpage that promotes the brand and showcases its products, which are created in 3D. The brand that gets the makeover is chosen from a list of beverage brands</p>

                <h2 class="step-title col-span-full">Research</h2>
                <img id="bb-step1" class="step-img col-span-full" src="images/case-studies/billy-beer/research.png" alt="billy-beer research">
                <p class="step-details col-span-full">The first part of the project is to consider what Billy Beer is going to be. We know that its a beer brand already, but we want to see what makes a good beer brand. We started by looking at popular brands, and how they are presented. Many beer brands have a strong type-based logo, with not much else besides the brand name. We decided to also create a logo strongly based on the type, with an icon to simply compliment it. We also found out some other things, like that beer brands typically have different types of brews and flavors for their beer. Website things also need to be considered, like what pages to include, and what should be included on those pages. We took a look at many different beer brand websites in order to see what they did.</p>

                <h2 class="step-title col-span-full">Basic Brand Identity</h2>
                <img class="step-img col-span-full" src="images/case-studies/billy-beer/Greyscale-Logo.png" alt="billy-beer brand identity">
                <p class="step-details col-span-full">One of the first things we needed was a logo for our brand. We worked together to sketch different ideas of a Billy Beer logo. The challenge is to try to do something unique to create a logo that is not only appealing, but distinct, and sets itself apart from others. Later on, we took one that we liked, and created a logo in Adobe Illustrator. We ended up with the brand name and a keg icon, because that strongly represents beer. The logo we ended up choosing was one that I had come up with, which used the keg, but also used a font that was chosen by my partner.</p>

                <img class="step-img col-span-full" src="images/case-studies/billy-beer/lofi-wireframe.png" alt="billy-beer wireframing">
                <p class="step-details col-span-full">Next, we need to start working on the website. To begin we start by wireframing, creating the basic layout of the site, and showing how the layout will change when the webpage is viewed at different sizes. Images are simply placeholder photos at this point, they wont be a part of the final site, and are mostly stock images and such.</p>

                <h2 class="step-title col-span-full">More Brand Identity</h2>
                <img class="step-img col-span-full" src="images/case-studies/billy-beer/style-guide.png" alt="billy-beer brand identity continued">
                <p class="step-details col-span-full">In order to continue working on the site, we need to further develop the brand identity, with things like fonts for the site, and color schemes. The Billy Beer logo will no longer be grayscale, and same with the entire wireframe. Overall, brand elements need to be considered in further detail. We also considered products, with our beer brand having its normal/plain brew of beer, stored in both a bottle and a can, and then mixed flavoured beers which are available in cans. Part of the project is creating a style guide, which records all the different aspects of brand identity in detail.</p>

                <p class="step-details col-span-full">Before our wireframes can be completed, we need to create the actual products that we will sell. These product images will replace the placeholder images, and our wireframe will look more complete. The product is 3D modeled and textured, while a label is also designed. There is a can, and a bottle, with 2 additional flavours. These models are then rendered into photos to be used in the final site.

                <p class="step-details col-span-full">Now that we have our finalized images and content, we can finish the wireframe. This will have the appearance of our final website, with the complete brand identity and content. We also prototype the wireframe, so that we can experiment with interactive elements of the site. This completed wireframe and site prototype will be used as reference while we develop the site.

                <p class="step-details col-span-full">We have everything we need to now complete the site. It is time to work together on the different pages to bring everything together, just how it is depicted on the wireframe. Responsive design needs to be considered, with images and layout responding to the web browser being resized. Interactive elements need to be implemented using Javascript.
