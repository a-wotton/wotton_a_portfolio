            <p class="col-span-full l-col-start-1 l-col-end-10">This project was a group undertaking, where each member had their own role to play, creating a responsive page. This page is designed for the Fanshawe College Industry Night Event, where people come to view Fanshawe student's portfolio. This site has some placeholder content in it, and is still a work in progress, but it shows a great deal of the work of everyone involved. The site contains information about the event, as well as containing info about students.</p>
            <h3 class="col-span-full l-col-start-1 l-col-end-10">Partners:</h3>
            <p class="col-span-full l-col-start-1 l-col-end-10">I worked on this project with three of my classmates: <a class="portfolio-link" href="#"> Dev Pandya</a>, <a class="portfolio-link" href="#">Jeet Patel</a> and <a class="portfolio-link" href="#"> Sahilkumar Gosaliya</a>. I helped with a lot of front end, working on HTML and CSS as well as some of the responsive design and a small amount of JavaScript. Dev worked on the promotional video, as well as other info about the event, as well as assisting with front-end design. Jeet did a lot of the design work for the site, and helped with implementing it on the front-end. Sahilkumar did a lot of front-end work, as well as doing revisions to design, and contributing a lot of the Javascript. </p>

            <h2 id="conclusion-title" class="step-title col-span-full">Skills Improved:</h2>
            <p class="skill col-span-full"><span>Wireframing</span> - I worked on some of the inital low-fidelity designs for the site, though a lot of that was revised and improved by the others; not much of the initial layout made it to the current version of the site. Wireframing was done using <span>Adobe XD</span>.</p>
            <p class="skill col-span-full"><span>Front End Development</span> - I worked on some of the front-end work for this site, using <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> and a little <span>Javascript.</span></p>
            <p class="skill col-span-full"><span>Collaboration</span> - This was my first project where I made a site as a member of a group of four. We all have a similar set of skills, but excel in our own areas. The challenge was to collaborate effectively, and try to break down the project into chunks, and determining who would work on what. We collaborated using <span>GitHub</span>.</p>
