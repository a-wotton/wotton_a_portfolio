            <p class="col-span-full l-col-start-1 l-col-end-10">For this project, a pair of wireless earbuds must be sketched out and designed in 3D, and then implemented on a responsive page. The page includes a slider that reveals an X-ray version of the earbuds, as well as an animation that progresses as the user scrolls down. Additionally, the earbuds are implemented as an AR object that the user can move around and view specific points of interest that will provide information about the earbuds.</p>

                <p class="step-details col-span-full">To begin, I wanted to get a good idea of how wireless earbuds look, and what kind of designs are currently popular. For the base shape of the earbuds, I wanted to take aspects from currently existing earbuds, but I also wanted to make my earbuds look unique. I compiled some of the earbuds that I liked, and began to sketch ideas for my own design.</p>

                <p class="step-details col-span-full">Before beginning the page, I went on to create the 3D assets that would be featured on the page. This part required me to take my sketches and bring them to life by reimagining it as a 3D object in a 3D space. Next, I need to texture the 3D models, and come up with the colors of the Earbuds. I also need to create an x-ray version containing each internal piece, all put together in photoshop. I created the earbuds and case all in Cinema 4D, and now they are ready to be included on the webpage.</p>

                <p class="step-details col-span-full">I lay out the base idea of the page layout, and now it is time to create the assets that will be included. Importing the 3D model data into an online model viewer site will allow me to customize how my model will be viewed on the web, and then automatically generate the code that makes it an interactable AR object. Then, I need to customize and style that code, in order to make it fit the theme of my page, and the colour of my earbuds. I then have to implement Javascript for the X-ray revealer, and render images for each frame of the scrolling animation, and have Greensock animate them on scroll.</p>

            <p class="skill col-span-full"><span>3D Modelling</span> - Modelling the earbuds expanded my knowledge on 3D, by having to realize my sketch in a 3D space, as well as texture it. This work was done in <span>Cinema 4D</span>.</p>
            <p class="skill col-span-full"><span>3D Animation</span> - I learned more about 3D animation while making the scrolling animation in <span>Cinema 4D</span>.</p>
            <p class="skill col-span-full"><span>Front End Development</span> - I expanded my front end skills by creating a responsive page, as well as expanding upon the model viewer code, and implementing unique features using Javascript. I improved my skills with <span>HTML, CSS,</span> and <span>Javascript</span>.</p>
            <p class="skill col-span-full"><span>Wireframing</span> - I improved my wireframing skills by designing the page layout from scratch, all done within <span>Adobe XD</span>.</p>
